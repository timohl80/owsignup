## üéØ **Objection Handling**

### **"We don't need the fancy stuff"**
*"I understand. The basic package gives you professional branding and security for just $800. That's less than most companies spend on coffee in a month."*

### **"We can build this ourselves"**
*"Absolutely, you could. But consider the time: 40-60 hours of development, testing, security review, and maintenance. At $100/hour, that's $4,000-6,000. Plus ongoing updates and support."*

### **"Our IT team is too busy"**
*"That's exactly why we offer complete setup assistance. We handle everything - you just provide the branding assets and we do the rest. Your team stays focused on core business."*

### **"We're not sure about Open WebUI long-term"**
*"This solution is designed to be portable. If you switch AI platforms, we can adapt the gateway. Plus, Open WebUI is open-source and growing rapidly - it's a solid choice."*

## üèÜ **Closing Script**

### **The Close (1 minute)**
*"Here's what I'm going to do for you today..."*

**Option 1 - Immediate Decision:**
*"I'll give you the Enterprise package for the Professional price - that's $1,800 instead of $3,500. But only if you decide today. This includes everything: custom branding, AI chatbot, security hardening, and 2 hours of setup assistance."*

**Option 2 - Trial Approach:**
*"Let's start with the Professional package. I'll set it up this week, and if you love it, we can upgrade to Enterprise features. If not, you're only out $1,800 and you still have a professional AI portal."*

**Option 3 - Pilot Program:**
*"I'll set up a pilot with the Basic package for $800. You can test it with a small group of users. If it works well, we upgrade to Professional. If not, you keep the basic version."*

### **Next Steps**
*"What I need from you is:*
1. *Your company logo and brand colors*
2. *Access to your Open WebUI installation*
3. *A decision on which package works best for you*

*I can have this running for you by [specific date]. What do you think?"*
